#Life in Weeks assumes living to 90 years, does not take into account leap years or weeks before next birthday, assumes integer 52 weeks

#First go
#print("What is your age?")
# age = input()
# age_int = int(age)
# life_in_weeks = (90 - age_int) * 52
# print(f"You have {life_in_weeks} weeks left to live")


#Cleaner version:
print("What is your age?")
age = input()

years = 90 - int(age)
weeks = years * 52

print(f"You have {weeks} weeks left to live")
